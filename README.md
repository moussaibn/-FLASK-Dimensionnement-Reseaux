## About:
This project built with the Flask framework and python 3 represents a representation of the erlang calculator.
This calculator estimates the number of voice lines you need. 

## Principle
Several traffic models exist that share their name with the Erlang unit of traffic. 
They are formulae that can be used to estimate the number of lines you require in a network or to a central office (telephone exchange). 
A formula was also established to model queuing situations, and lends itself well to estimating the agent staffing requirements of call centers.

The main Erlang traffic model are listed below, with links to my free online Erlang calculators:

### Erlang B
The most commonly used traffic model, it estimates how many lines you need if you know the traffic figure (in Erlangs) during your busiest hour.

## Erlang C
This traffic model assumes that all blocked calls stay in the system until they can be handled. You can apply it to the design of call center staffing arrangements where calls enter a queue if they are not answered immediately.
